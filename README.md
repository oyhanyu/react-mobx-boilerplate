# **react-mobx-boilerplate**

A react boilerplate with a powerful state container

# Usage

If your project needs more customization, you can "eject" and customize it,
and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off,
but then you will need to maintain this configuration.
$ yarn eject
```
